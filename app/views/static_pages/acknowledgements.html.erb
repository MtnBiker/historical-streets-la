<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>

<p>This project would not have been possible without MaptimeLA and their recent activities visiting CSUN and UCLA to learn about their map collections. Chris Salvano, now the CSUN map curator, built <%= link_to "San Francisco Historical Street Names Index", "http://www.chrissalvano.com/lost-san-francisco/san-francisco-historical-street-names-index-update" %> which lead me to thinking about this project</p>

<p>This page will be developed, but for now you can look at the <%= link_to "acknowledgements for a related project", "https://secure-shore-68966.herokuapp.com/acknowledgements" %> which uses many of the same resources.</p>
