<h1>About</h1>
Developed to support <%= link_to "Croatian Run Restaurants in Los Angeles", "https://secure-shore-68966.herokuapp.com" %>, 
but also because I saw a general need and leveraged the work of <p><a href="http://stevemorse.org/census/changes/LosAngelesChanges2.htm">Los Angeles in the 1900s&mdash;Streets of a Hundred Years Ago</a>. Morse's site is a treasure trove of historical and genealogical information. Almost all of the information is from this resource. I've added the ability to put that information on a map. </p>
<p>The scanned maps came from sources linked to on the map. All georeferencing of the individual scanned maps was done using QGIS. Then those were exported as a set of tiles using the QGIS plug-in QTiles.</p>
