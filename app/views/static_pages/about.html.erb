<h1>About</h1>
<p>Developed to support <%= link_to "Croatian Run Restaurants in Los Angeles", crores_path, target: :_blank %>, 
but since it was being done; may as well lets others use and contribute.</p>

<p>Almost all of the initial street history information is from <a href="http://stevemorse.org/census/changes/LosAngelesChanges2.htm">Los Angeles in the 1900s&mdash;Streets of a Hundred Years Ago</a>. I&rsquo;ve added the ability to put that information on a map. <%= link_to  'Morse\'s site', 'http://stevemorse.org/', target: :_blank  %> is a treasure trove of historical and genealogical information. </p>

<p>Just established <%= link_to "Facebook", facebook_path, target: :_blank  %> and <%= link_to "Twitter", twitter_path, target: :_blank  %>.</p>

<p>The scanned maps came from sources linked to on the map. All georeferencing of the individual scanned maps was done using QGIS. Then those were exported as a set of tiles using the QGIS plug-in QTiles.</p>
