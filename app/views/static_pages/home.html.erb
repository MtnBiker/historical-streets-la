<h1>Street Name Changes in Los Angeles</h1>

<p>A compilation of the history of the street name changes in Los Angeles and the changes on a map.</p>

<p>Initially to support <%= link_to "Croatian Run Restaurants in Los Angeles 1880—1930", "https://secure-shore-68966.herokuapp.com" %>
but then saw a general need and was able to leverage the extensive list published by Steve Morse: 
<%= link_to "Los Angeles in the 1900s—Streets of a Hundred Years Ago", "http://stevemorse.org/census/changes/LosAngelesChanges2.htm" %>. 
<%= link_to "Morse's site", "http://stevemorse.org/" %> is a treasure trove of historical and geneological information. Almost all of the information is from this resource. I've added the ability to put that information on a map and have started to do that for some of the 500 or so entries. After launching the site, anyone will be able to add or edit the entries.</p>

<p>Inspired by <%= link_to "Chris Salvano's San Francisco Historical Street Names Index", "http://www.chrissalvano.com/lost-san-francisco/san-francisco-historical-street-names-index-update" %> and <%= link_to "MaptimeLA", "http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeLA/" %>  people, workshops and tutorials.

<p>The historic maps can be slow to appear. The coverage of the maps varies and sometimes no map will be available for the area of interest.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: The database will be refreshed, in other words, you can Signup and make changes, but both will probably disappear. Will go live soon, but I want to make sure it's all working right. But please let me know if you have any <%= link_to "comments or suggestions", contact_path %>.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out <%= link_to "Sign up", signup_path %>, otherwise just proceed to <%= link_to 'to the list of Historic Streets', streets_path %>.</p>
