<h1>Street Name Changes in Los Angeles</h1>

<p>A compilation of the history of the street name changes in Los Angeles and the changes on a map.</p>

<p>I started this to support <%= link_to "Croatian Run Restaurants in Los Angeles 1880—1930", "https://secure-shore-68966.herokuapp.com", target: "_blank" %>
but then saw a general need and was able to leverage the extensive list published by Steve Morse: 
<%= link_to "Los Angeles in the 1900s—Streets of a Hundred Years Ago", "http://stevemorse.org/census/changes/LosAngelesChanges2.htm", target: "_blank" %>. 
<%= link_to "Morse's site", "http://stevemorse.org/" , target: "_blank"%> is a treasure trove of historical and geneological information. Almost all of the information is from this resource. I've added the ability to put that information on a map and have started to do that for some of the 500 or so entries. After launching the site, anyone will be able to add or edit the entries.</p>
<p>Have to add earliest Spanish names shown on some maps. Calle de las Primarera for Spring. Were those official? They're on an 1857 Bancock and Thayer et.al. map</p>

<p>Inspired by <%= link_to "Chris Salvano's San Francisco Historical Street Names Index", "http://www.chrissalvano.com/lost-san-francisco/san-francisco-historical-street-names-index-update", target: "_blank" %> and <%= link_to "MaptimeLA", "http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeLA/" , target: "_blank"%>  people, workshops and tutorials.

<p>The historic maps can be slow to appear. The coverage of the maps varies and sometimes no map will be available for the area of interest.</p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: The database will be refreshed, in other words, you can Signup and make changes, but both will probably disappear. Will go live soon, but I want to make sure it's all working right. But please let me know if you have any <%= link_to "comments or suggestions", contact_path %>.</p>

<p>If you want to try it out <%= link_to "Sign up", signup_path %>, otherwise just proceed to <%= link_to 'to the list of Historic Streets', streets_path %>.</p>

<p>I could end up with a long list of local lists. For now I'm focusing the list on the City of Los Angeles, but should allow for other cities in the county. Here's a link to street name history for <%= link_to "Redondo Beach", "http://www.redondohistorical.org/?page_id=858" , target: "_blank"%> at the Redondo Beach Historical Society</p>
