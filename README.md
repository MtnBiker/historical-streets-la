Beta deployment: https://stark-cove-20051.herokuapp.com/. Although as of 2017.06.05 not working. Concentrating on getting it working on localhost. One more essential feature to add then will focus on deployment

Developed to support https://secure-shore-68966.herokuapp.com
but also because I saw a general need and leveraged the work started by  <a href="http://stevemorse.org/census/changes/LosAngelesChanges2.htm">Los Angeles in the 1900s&mdash;Streets of a Hundred Years Ago</a>. Morse's site is a treasure trove of historical and geneological information. Almost all of the information is from this resource. I've added the ability to put that information on a map. 

Planned after initial deployment is an overview map showing all the changed streets. Followed by a timeline. Etc.
