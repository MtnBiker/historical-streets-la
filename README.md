# README
Rails 5.1 since supposed to have beter JS asset management, Ruby 2.4

Wiped out old rails app except folder and .gitignore
Git 3- , may have forgotten to merge
rails new la_hist_street [asked if wanted to overwrite .gitignore and I said no]
Copied over stuff to Gemfile including bundler, much from crores5
bundle
bundle update
database.yml to postgis
rails db:create db:migrate
added line to config/application.rb config.active_record.schema_format = :sql. should have done it before above
rails g scaffold Street prevName:string currentName:string dateEarliest:string dateLatest:string where:string  extent:line_string numBlocks:string ref1:text ref2:text ref3:text notes:text --force since I am reusing some of this rails
yarn add jquery
yarn add bootstrap
yarn add bootstrap@4.0.0-alpha.6

@bootstrap-sprockets is commented out. Should I add //= require bootstrap-sprockets to application.js to make it work?
or gem 'sprockets-rails', :require => 'sprockets/railtie'

To import csv, using right click on table streets to bring up import. Changed created_at and update_at to accept null. did not import index. Couldn't change back to null!!! Fixed below
Ran these in pgAdmin (Got correct format using puts DateTime.now.httpdate and didn't sweat the GMT not being PDT -07:00; This format matched what I saw in crores5 database)
UPDATE Streets
SET updated_at = 'Sat, 27 May 2017 15:51:14 GMT';

UPDATE Streets
SET created_at = 'Sat, 27 May 2017 15:51:00 GMT';

in pgAdmin changed definition of created_at and updated_at to 'not NULL ' 

Index to Bootstrap 4. Use crores5 people as an example which is Bootstrap 3

Looking at editing in place

https://github.com/janv/rest_in_place. Simple gem ? Try this first in a git

https://github.com/infinum/phrasing Lots of pieces but may do the job

https://adityashedge.wordpress.com/2014/01/05/in-place-editable-table-with-jquery/, not clear to me how to implement. Apparently add the .js, But simple. Easiest to try

https://github.com/bootstrap-ruby/bootstrap-editable-rails Looks fairly straightforward. I think it wraps http://vitalets.github.io/x-editable/index.html  into a Rails gem
