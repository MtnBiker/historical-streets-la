Add search for street and return to map at center of the segment

1928 Hill's needs more detailed georeferencing

1902 Rueger needs trimming. Unfortunately probably have to georef again.

Add another page with all the segments mapped. Maybe can do a SQL to find all the segments and make a JSON or maybe it happens automagically. Need  popups. 
And then have date slider.

Error if edit from streets. Probably in the ugly decision tree. Look at gon

Section 5.3.4 testing mostly not working

Link colors have problems. Changed to teal, but that doesn't work with blue background buttons

Option to paginate. Gems are installed. Two places change. streets/users_controller.rb lines 7/8 and two erbs for pagination on streets/index.html.erb

Get rid of example user when I get myself set up on localhost

Make the signup and password reset emails and HTML a bit more professional

Look at puma.rb and see if hidden stuff is needed

Login should take you back to the page you were on

Add attribution to changes

Put up a notice if no coverage available for the map selected.

The overlay maps selection column needs to have radio button next to text. At least now scrunched enough can tell. But need to get into Bootstrap 4 more. Maybe with next version I'll did into it.
